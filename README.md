# projectsOverview
my personal collection for some of the interesting priojects that i've done.

***C# RouteFinder project done together with /obbteam: https://github.com/obbteam/cycling-map

Everything else can be found and seen within subdirectories of this repository

Additionally, I have enjoyed experimenting with some basic graphics, eventually doing project using SFML library on C++, for example:
1) particle simulation using threading - https://github.com/Rizame/-ParticleSimulation-
2) a fully functional local tic tac toe game with custom graphics and implemented with usage of state machine for different scenes - https://github.com/Rizame/TicTacToe
3) visualisation of how sorting algorithms work - https://github.com/Rizame/-VisualisedSortingAlgorithms-
